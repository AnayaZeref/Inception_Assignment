1. What is Emmet?
>>Answer: Emmet is a tool that helps you write HTML and JSX code faster by using shortcuts. Itâ€™s built into many code editors like VS Code, 
       and it expands simple abbreviations into full code snippets.
  EXAMPLE:<div className="container">
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  </div>
        Emmet will turn this above JSX code into a shortcut.
  SHORTCUT(Emmet code):div.container>h1{Hello}
  When you write the above emmet code into code editor it will automatically convert it into the original JSX code. 
  Some code editors like VSCode supports and have built-in emmets.

2. Difference between Library and Framework.  
>>Answer:
   Framework:
   Think of a framework as a pre-built house. It provides the structure, plumbing, and wiring. You just move in and furnish it according to 
   your needs. The framework calls your code at specific points, guiding the flow of your application.
   Library:

   the library when you need them.
